                        As a final year computer science major with a minor in psychology at the University of Victoria in Canada, I am excited
                        to be graduating in April 2023. Throughout my academic journey, I have demonstrated a strong aptitude for
                        problem-solving and thrive in collaborative team environments.
                        
                        With thorough experience in Java, data structures, algorithms, and object-oriented languages, I have taken various
                        programming-related courses, including software development, human-computer interaction, and neuroscience psychology.
                        Additionally, my coursework in psychology statistics and personality psychology has equipped me with a unique
                        perspective on the intersection between technology and human behavior.
                        
                        I am currently seeking full-time opportunities beginning in May 2023 and am eager to contribute my skills and knowledge
                        to a dynamic organization. Please feel free to reach out to connect or learn more about my experience and
                        qualifications.
